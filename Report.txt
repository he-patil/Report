DRY : Function needs to be added for find contact, find contact details, find user
KISS : code is preety state-forward
YAGNI : No unrequired code found
SOC : crud on ContactDetails should be in Contact class, found in User class, no all User list
TDA : For CRUD operation, dependency on calling code to find the concerned object to do operations on.
        Extra work for calling funtion code would make it complex.
